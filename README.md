### Note : Please make sure that you have included configuration for the CatMullRomSpline.h which is located in include folder

### If you are using VS-code you can also make use of my ".vscode" folder and modify the binary-paths accordingly

### Run the main.cpp file to get the following output

## Output for the input of 4 points
